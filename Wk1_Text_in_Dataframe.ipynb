    "In the information age, understanding customer sentiment can be a crucial factor in the success of any business.\n",

    "Yelp, a popular platform for business reviews, is a treasure trove of such information. Reviews on Yelp can significantly influence customer behavior, so analyzing the language used in reviews can provide valuable insights into customer experience, service quality, and much more.\n",

    "However, the sheer volume of text data can be overwhelming.\n",

    "In this lesson, you learned how to create subsets of your data when the text is stored in a dataframe. You also learned how to apply preprocessing to data in dataframes using SpaCy to create tokenized data without punctuation and stopwords, as well as lemmatized data. Finally, you learned how to recombine the lists of tokenized and lemmatized words in each document into one string per document. Keeping multiple forms of your data is useful for different EDA and modeling techniques."
